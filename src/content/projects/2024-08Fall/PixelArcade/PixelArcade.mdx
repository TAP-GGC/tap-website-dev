title: A Comparison of Game-Based Learning Online vs In-Person with Binary
id: PixelArcade
desc: Pixel Arcade is an interactive 2D game that will instruct students about the basics of binary. It was built using Unity and C#. Binary is the basis of how computers, photo editing, RGB, audio, and many other technologies work, which is why we wanted to get students familiar with it early on. Participants will play a tutorial and then 3 mini-games.

## About

Pixel Arcade is a 2D interactive game built with Unity with the purpose
of teaching binary to students ranging from middle school to college.{" "}

Unity uses C# for programming
games in 3D, 2D, or even AR and VR. The project provides students with the opportunity
to develop an interest in the technology field through engaging with educational
games.

The Technology Ambassador Program at GGC strives to break the misconceptions of the IT field by providing fun workshops for students of all backgrounds. TAP students design engaging and fun outreach workshops to encourage interest in IT and STEM.
