{/* Right text block, Project description */}	
This project introduces students to the basics of static web development through the creation of a digital business card.
Using Glitch and NFC chips, students will create personalized web pages to share their background, experiences, goals, and social links.

The Technology Ambassador Program at [GGC](http://www.ggc.edu/tap) strives to break the misconceptions of the IT field by providing fun workshops for students of all backgrounds. TAP students design engaging and fun outreach workshops to encourage interest in IT and STEM.
