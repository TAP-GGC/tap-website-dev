id: Using Lego Spike Prime Sets to Teach Essential Coding Concepts
desc : This project utilizes LEGO SPIKE sets to create an interactive, educational experience aimed at teaching basic coding concepts through a hands-on workshop. Participants build and program a catapult to hit color-coded targets, simulating a carnival game. This engaging approach helps learners understand fundamental coding concepts such as variables, conditionals, and loops.
